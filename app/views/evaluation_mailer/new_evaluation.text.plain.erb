Hello <%= @evaluation.sent_to_name %>!

Please complete the following recommendation form for <%= [@evaluation.official.full_name] %> for Q2016. In order to ensure the best officials in the right assignments, it is imperative for us to gather feedback from the district and regional directors.  Please take a few minutes to complete the recommendation as thoroughly as possible.

Please complete this request as soon as you can. Once recommendations are received for an official and the official is selected to serve, a final registration link will be sent to them to complete the process.

<%= "#{AppConfig.site_url}/evaluation/#{@evaluation.key}" %>

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Todd Olson
Q2016 Coordinator of Officials
