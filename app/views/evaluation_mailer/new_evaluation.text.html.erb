    <p>Hello <%= h @evaluation.sent_to_name %>!</p>
    <p>
      Please complete the following recommendation form for <%= h @evaluation.official.full_name %> for Q2016. In order to ensure the best officials in the right assignments, it is imperative for us to gather feedback from the district and regional directors.  Please take a few minutes to complete the recommendation as thoroughly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please complete this request as soon as you can. Once recommendations are received for an official and the official is selected to serve, a final registration link will be sent to them to complete the process.
